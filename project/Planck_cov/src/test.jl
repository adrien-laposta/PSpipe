# # Rational numbers
#
# In julia rational numbers can be constructed with the `//` operator.
# Lets define two rational numbers, `x` and `y`:

## Define variable x and y
x = 1//3
y = 2//5

# When adding `x` and `y` together we obtain a new rational number:

z = x + y

## Let's plot something
using Plots
x = range(0, stop=6Ï€, length=1000)
y1 = sin.(x)
y2 = cos.(x)

plot(x, y1)
plot!(x, y2)

# Testing math
# ```math
# \int f dx
# ```

# Introduction

This is a Simons Observatory pipeline for computing the spectra and covariances of the
[Planck 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.12875) high-``\ell`` likelihood. Default
settings have been chosen to reproduce the official ``\texttt{plic}`` analysis. The
code is also described in Li et al. (in prep). **Each page
is directly generated from a source file used in the pipeline**, in the style of
[Literate programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming). Each source
file can be located on the [PSPipe GitHub](https://github.com/simonsobs/PSpipe) using the
*Edit on GitHub* link on the top of every page.

* All executed code within a pipeline component is displayed in light orange code blocks.
* Comments in the pipeline components are rendered as markdown.
* The rendered pages are run on low-resolution *Planck* 2018 half-mission maps and masks
  at 143 GHz, generated by harmonically reprojecting to ``n_{\mathrm{side}} = 256``.
* At the top of each page, we provide examples for how to run the pipeline component
  on the *Planck* data.
* For the full analysis described in Li et al. (in prep), consult the page on the Slurm
  files and cluster use.

The map/alm handling routines for this project were contributed into
the [Healpix.jl](https://ziotom78.github.io/Healpix.jl/dev/) package, and the
mode-coupling and covariance matrix calculations were made into
[AngularPowerSpectra.jl](https://xzackli.github.io/AngularPowerSpectra.jl/dev/).
This pipeline mostly wrangles data and calls the routines from those packages.


## Package Installation
We use the package manager in the Julia interpeter
install the latest versions of Healpix and AngularPowerSpectra. This will be simpler in
the future, when we tag a stable version of these packages for the General Registry. 
For now, we add the latest versions of these packages from GitHub. Note that package 
installation requires an internet connection, so unlike the other parts of the pipeline,
`setup.jl` requires an internet connection. If you're on a cluster, that means you need 
to run this file on the head node in order to install packages.

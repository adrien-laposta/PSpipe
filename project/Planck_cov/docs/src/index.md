# Introduction
This is a Simons Observatory pipeline for computing the spectra and covariances of the
[Planck 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.12875) high-``\ell`` likelihood, with default
settings chosen to reproduce the official ``\texttt{plic}`` analysis. The
code is described in Li et al. (in prep). **Each page
is directly generated from a source file used in the pipeline**, in the style of
[Literate programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming). Each source
file can be located on the [PSPipe GitHub](https://github.com/simonsobs/PSpipe) using the
*Edit on GitHub* link on the top of every page.

* Comments in the pipeline components are rendered as markdown.
* The rendered pages are run on low-resolution *Planck* 2018 half-mission maps and masks
  at 143 GHz, generated by harmonically reprojecting to ``n_{\mathrm{side}} = 256``.
* At the top of each page, we provide examples for how to run the pipeline component
  on the *Planck* data.
* For the full analysis described in Li et al. (in prep), consult the page on the Slurm
  files and cluster use.

The map/alm handling routines for this project were contributed into
the [Healpix.jl](https://ziotom78.github.io/Healpix.jl/dev/) package, and the
mode-coupling and covariance matrix calculations were put into
[AngularPowerSpectra.jl](https://xzackli.github.io/AngularPowerSpectra.jl/dev/).
This pipeline mostly wrangles the data and calls the routines from those packages.

## Installation
You need a working [Julia](https://julialang.org/) installation in order to run this
pipeline. Once you have a working installation, you should use the package manager to
install the latest versions of Healpix and AngularPowerSpectra.

```@example index
using Pkg
Pkg.add(PackageSpec(name="Healpix", rev="master"))
Pkg.add(PackageSpec(name="AngularPowerSpectra", rev="master"))
```

## Configuration
This particular file (`index.jl`) mostly serves as documentation, but does print out the
global configuration file `global.toml`. All of the pipeline scripts take a configuration
TOML file as the first argument. Run this file using
```bash
julia index.jl global.toml
```

```@example index
pwd()
```

```@example index
using TOML
config = TOML.parsefile("../lit/global.toml")
TOML.print(config)
```

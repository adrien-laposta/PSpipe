This page describes the different projects we are working on in PSPipe, they are at different states of completion/documentation

maps2params 
===========

The goal of this project is to make a simplistic 'end-to-end' simulation analysis.
We start with a set of cosmological parameters, a foreground model and an instrument model.
We generate simulations of the sky for different frequency channels, convolve them with the beams of the instrument, and add to them experimental noise.
We compute the power spectra of the simulations given a galactic, survey a point source mask and compute their associated covariance matrices.

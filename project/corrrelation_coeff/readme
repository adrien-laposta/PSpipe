This folder contain documented codes used for the paper: The TE correlation coefficient of Planck legacy data
It contains different python scripts that can be used to reproduce the analysis.
First you need to install PSPy, detailed instruction to the installation at NERSC are provided in:
https://github.com/simonsobs/PSpipe

Then you have to download the public 2018 planck data this can be achieved by running:

python get_planck_data.py global.dict

Note that before doing so, you should specify the path to the data directory using the 'data_dir' key in global.dict.

Now we should compute planck power spectra, to do so, we proceed in two different steps:
1) First compute
